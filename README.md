# btpd-grasslands

These data were collected from black-tailed prairie dogs in Grasslands National Park between 2015 and 2017. 

Vigilance_Density.csv contains data for individuals spent vigilant over the course of 15 minutes, with the density of burrows within their coterie (home range). 

Density_Cort.csv contains glucocorticoid (cortisol) data (collected from hair) for individual prairie dogs across 4 time periods. Burrow density, lactation status, age, mass in grams, and hind foot measure in mm are also included. 

Repro_Cort.csv contains reproductive success data measured as number of pups emerged from the burrow for each adult female (litter size)  as well as a binary count for a litter attempt. Glucocorticoid data is included for 4 time periods. The cort data from the fall precedes the litter size count for the following spring.
